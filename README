# Automatizing Data Extraction for Replicability Analysis using Z-Curve

This repository contains the code that was used in the project discussed at DGPS 2024, Vienna.

There are three folders, containing the executable RMarkdown files, the rendered html files that might be nicer if you want to read through the files without running the code, and a python folder containing an example file of how to run grobid to convert pdfs to xml.

The files are numbered to indicate the order in which you would use them, where a and b versions are alternatives, that do not need to be both run.

This repository is only meant as a temporary demonstration of the code.
However, the code will be migrated to another repository in the long term and pointed to from this one.
The code is currently only meant as a working example, and might still contain errors, and is poorly documented.
It should, however, already be usable in it's current state.
